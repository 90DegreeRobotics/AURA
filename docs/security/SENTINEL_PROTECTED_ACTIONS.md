# Sentinel Protected Actions — Aura

Inventory of protected actions for Aura. Unlisted protected surfaces are stop-ship findings.
**Status:** Implementing L0 runtime + first launcher slice. Full v1 census remains blocked on
Q1 organ freeze. Canonical Core IDs live in
`C:\sentinel-core\docs\security\SENTINEL_PROTECTED_ACTIONS.md`. Full census reasoning:
`docs/plans/AURA_MASTER_PLAN.md` Part XVIII.

## Inventory Rules

- List every operation that can change state, reveal sensitive information, affect a person, affect hardware, communicate externally, execute tools, launch processes, modify memory/identity, or influence model behavior toward harm.
- Each row must name the mediation point, preferred Core action ID, and the deny test that proves failure before side effects.
- Unclassified surfaces for a **frozen** v1 scope are stop-ship. v1 organ set (master plan Q1) is still Open — census cannot close until Q1 closes.
- Do not invent Aura-only allow paths. Map to Core IDs or propose Core registry additions.

## Explicit Non-Protected Surfaces

| Surface | Location | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safe health | Planned `/health` | Read-only health, no sensitive disclosure |
| Launcher status refresh | `crates/aura_launcher` | Display-only runtime status refresh |
| Document DB status refresh | `crates/aura_launcher` | Display-only path/count summary; no document source read and no DB append |
| Sentinel initializing UI | `crates/aura_launcher` | Display-only blocked/init state |
| Deny / lockdown chrome | Shell | Display-only |
| Emergency stop | OS / hardware | Independent safety brake; never an approval path |
| Preboot journal | Local | Minimal journal that cannot approve work |

## Unclassified Surfaces

| Surface | Location | Why unclassified | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _(blocked on Q1 v1 organ freeze)_ | | Cannot close census until v1 scope is Founder-frozen | Plan P3 | After Q1 |

Update this file in the same change that specifies any new protected surface.
